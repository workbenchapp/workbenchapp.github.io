                        The goal of DAOnetes is to unlock a global supercomputer
                        that is not reliant on monolithic architectures or
                        centralized cloud providers. DAOnetes will enable you to
                        network computers together, run workloads on them, and
                        have a nice experience while doing so.

                    <h4>Why?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We think that moving to interoperable and shared
                        protocols for workloads is inevitable. Let's talk about
                        why this will happen, and then on why DAOnetes will be a
                        part of it.

                    <h5>Why Fungible Workloads Are Inevitable</h5>
                    <strong>Lock-in</strong>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with the most obvious reason: lock-in. While
                        there are always ebbs and flows between proprietary and
                        open technology, as in stands in 2022, large vendors
                        have tons of leverage against their customers. By its
                        nature, this situation will continue to foment impulses
                        towards open systems as vendors are tempted to take
                        advantage of this position, or even compete compete with
                        their customers. Part and parcel with this impulse will
                        be a desire to migrate to
                        <i>fungible workloads</i> where the implementation
                        details of where you are running something are fully
                        abstracted away.
                    </p>

                        Docker was one expression of this. As a "cloud
                        Switzerland", its promise of portable workloads was a
                        great step towards decoupling <i>what we do</i> from
                        <i> where we do it </i>. The popularity of

                        demonstrates that there is demand for running such a

                        an article from Duckbill Group founder Corey Quinn,
                        Corey lists three razor-sharp insights into why cloud
                        vendors have you locked in even more tightly than it
                        might seem:

                            Once engineers have learned the nuances of one
                            cloud, they are heavily incentivized to stick with
                            it.

                            >
                            Clouds have no system to port identity, and arguably
                            couldn't do so if they wanted to because there is no
                            neutral broker.

                            >
                            Costs to move data are too painful once you have
                            generated a lot of it within one particular cloud.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Corey's conclusion, to be fair, was
                        <i>"It's hopeless"</i> ... but what if it wasn't? What
                        happens as the pain of this massive pile of leverage
                        cloud providers have over you grows and grows? Fungible
                        workloads offer one way to help do
                        <i>something</i> about that pain, even if they can't
                        eliminate it completely.

                        is yet another inevitable trend in our evolving world as
                        we plug in countless devices and connect them to the
                        Internet. Not only does each generate massive volumes of
                        data, many of them cannot be utilitized to their full
                        potential because they cannot connect and interoperate.
                        Even transporting all the data we'd like to has become a
                        pain. We are so constrained by bandwidth that

                    <p>
                        Due to these and many other forces, an ever-increasing
                        amount of computing is going to be happening at the
                        location where the data you are working with exists,
                        rather than having the data sent to where the computing
                        happens (e.g., a datacenter in Virginia). Unfortunately,
                        this generates a new set of problems. As anyone who has
                        worked with on-premise software will tell you,
                        troubleshooting and maintaining consistency across
                        disparate environments is a source of endless headaches.
                        Anything that helps those environments be more
                        consistent is important, and that includes fungibility
                        of workloads.

                        As we explored modern blockchain systems, we realized

                        to build a portable computing platform. For instance:

                            Bootstrapping needs a magic proprietary escape hatch
                            like AWS DynamoDB for devices to discover each

                            By signing transactions, users can cryptographically
                            approve operations, and validate that they have
                            certain permissions.

                            Visibility into Shadow IT is difficult. But the
                            chain is a strong ledger with a perfect history of
                            everything that's happened.

                    <p>
                        So we invented a new solution for connecting computers
                        together and running workloads —
                        <a href="https://daonetes.org">DAOnetes</a>. It will
                        enable you to plug in and out of arbitrary clusters by
                        leveraging the consistency that containers offer,
                        alongside the ability of the blockchain to trustlessly
                        transact, port identity, and form groups for delegation
                        of responsibility. You will be able to bring your own
                        cloud. Eventually, operations experts will bring theirs,
                        and sell services for you to use, just like AWS does,
                        but operated transparently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Why the
                        <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization"
                            >"DAO"</a
                        >? Because one cryptographic signature is far from
                        enough. Multiple signers in a shared system of identity
                        makes it possible to verify that multiple people have
                        signed off on which devices are approved to be a part of
                        running workloads, which types of workloads are allowed
                        to be run, and which workloads are currently running.
                        Whether it's in a private chain or public, an elliptic
                        curve is the same everywhere.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Not only will you be able to use the same system of
                        identity to sign a Docker image as you will to deploy
                        it, you will be able to connect to other users who
                        signed as part of these decisions alongside you.

                    <h5>Why DAOnetes Will Drive This Change</h5>
                    <p>
                        But if even if those theses are true, why us? Why
                        DAOnetes?

                    <p>
                        What we bring to the table is expertise in developer
                        experience and making technology accessible, and a fire
                        burning to bring this vision to life. We are deploying
                        the program on the
                        <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> chain due to
                        its high performance, low fees, and strong vision. The
                        DAOnetes architecture is below and we welcome feedback
                        on the dapp

                        In a nutshell, devices (runtime environments) are joined
                        to a "work group" which has a central authority that
                        could be an individual user key or a DAO. This central
                        authority is responsible for operations such as adding
                        workload specifications (Docker Compose files) to the
                        group, approving devices to be a part of the group, and
                        scheduling workloads onto specific devices.
